# Human-Resources
Welcome to my HR journey repository! 🌱  
From a background in horticulture to diving deep into human resources, I've always been passionate about learning what makes people thrive at work. This repo captures my HR milestones—certifications, projects, and insights—as I build my way through talent acquisition, employee experience, and beyond.

## What's Inside

Here’s what you’ll find in this space:

- **📚 Certifications**  
  *The knowledge I’m constantly acquiring in HR* — completed courses, key takeaways, and reflections.

- **🔍 Projects**  
  *Real-world HR initiatives that I’m working on* — from recruitment frameworks to onboarding revamps, and maybe a few creative experiments along the way.

- **🛠️ Tools & Resources**  
  *Everything that aids me in my growth as an HR professional* — templates, guides, frameworks, and thought-starters.

## Why This Exists

I believe in building people-first workplaces. And to do that well, I want to deeply understand both *people* and *systems*.  
This repo is a small attempt to bring that learning out of my inbox and into the world.

## About Me

Hi, I’m Yash — currently shifting gears from an in-house HR role into the PGDM journey @ GIM.  

I stumbled into HR after graduating in horticulture (yes, plants to people. go figure.)  
Since then, it’s been a ride full of resumes, roadblocks, and some very *"you believed in me!"* moments :)

If you're into human-centered work or enjoy thoughtful HR convos (or even just want to sit silently in the same Google Doc and think), let’s connect.
